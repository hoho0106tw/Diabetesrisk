Using a Cox proportional hazards (hazard) model to estimate the risk of developing diabetes within 5 years.
The model uses baseline patient risk factors and follow-up time, and it can properly handle patients who are not observed for the full 5 years.
It outputs an individual 5-year diabetes risk, which can be used for risk stratification and prevention planning.
